# Markdown Notes
These are notes I took while studying from [Scrimba's Learn Markdown Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/markdownblog) and [MarkdownGuide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) as a part of my effort to improve [my GitHub](https://github.com/JoeDukes/) README.md files.

## H2
### H3 etc

A horizontal rule is a blank new line and then 3 dashes

## formatting
* Use 1 asterick on each side for *italics*

* Use 3 astericks on each side for ***bold italic***
* Use 2 tildas on each side for ~~strikethrough~~
* Use triple back ticks on each side for ```code```
* Use asterick, dash, or plus at the start of a line followed by a space for unordered lists

## blockquotes
> "Let's add a quote here by using a >"

### blockquotes with paragraphs

## links and images
[My link text](www.mylink.org "My title text.")

<!-- This is the normal way to do images but if the size sucks then just use an image tag with alt and width/height
![Alt text](./images/image-icon.jpg "Title text")
-->

<img src="./images/image-icon.jpg" alt="image icon" width="50">

### An image as a link
[![Alt Text](./images/image-icon.jpg "Image title text")](www.mylink.org "Link title text")

## Emails
Emails are just the email inside a tag aka inside <>, so <github@dukesmail.com>

## emojis
Use colon on each side of the emoji name :grinning:
